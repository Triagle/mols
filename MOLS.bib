                  {\$}{\$}n=q^2{\$}{\$}n=q2, q a prime power, a set of
                  {\$}{\$}q^2-q-1{\$}{\$}q2-q-1MOSLS of order

                  {\$}{\$}q^2-q{\$}{\$}q2-qMOSLS. This contrasts to the theory
                  of ordinary Latin squares of order n, where each set of
                  {\$}{\$}n-2{\$}{\$}n-2mutually orthogonal Latin Squares (MOLS)
                  can be extended to a set of {\$}{\$}n-1{\$}{\$}n-1MOLS (which
                  is best possible). For this proof, we construct a particular
                  maximal partial spread of size {\$}{\$}q^2-q+1{\$}{\$}q2-q+1in
                  {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathrm {\{}PG{\}}(3,q){\$}{\$}PG(3,q)and
                  use a connection between Sudoku Latin squares and projective

  abstract        = {A (d,n,r,t)-hypercube is an n×n×⋯×n (d-times) array on nr
                  symbols such that when fixing t coordinates of the hypercube
                  (and running across the remaining d−t coordinates) each symbol
                  is repeated nd−r−t times. We introduce a new parameter, r,
                  representing the class of the hypercube. When r=1, this
                  provides the usual definition of a hypercube and when d=2 and
                  r=t=1 these hypercubes are Latin squares. If d⩾2r, then the
                  notion of orthogonality is also inherited from the usual
                  definition of hypercubes. This work deals with constructions
                  of class r hypercubes and presents bounds on the number of
                  mutually orthogonal class r hypercubes. We also give
                  constructions of sets of mutually orthogonal hypercubes when n
                  is a prime power.}
